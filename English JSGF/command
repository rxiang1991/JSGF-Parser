Great minds think alike
Look before you leap
Diamond cuts diamond
Dead men tell no tales
Tomorrow never comes
You have my word
Put the cart before the horse
United we stand
Hunger is the best sauce
No sweet without sweat
Impossible is nothing
Gold will not buy anything
Once a thief always a thief
Much would have more
No pains no gains
Many hands make light work
Like father like son
Nothing brave nothing have
Second thoughts are best
Think today and speak tomorrow
Make your enemy your friend
Light come light go
Spring follows winter
What must be must be
Might is right
Ill counsel mars all
Good counsel has no price
Good counsel never comes too late
Even homer sometimes nods
Nothing seek nothing find
